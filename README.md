# Zapret-mod-by-Gerson
Im did some changes in tho(added some things in ipset-all and list-general). added link(and ip): telegram, whatsapp, github(in case if it get blocked), rule34(dont ask why), tor, roblox and reactormag.
THAT IS JUST MOD, COPYRIGHT IS BY FLOWSEAL!!!
# INSTRUCTION
At first, check your ipset-all in lists. if tho have no ip's, then open backup(ipset-all.backup), copypaste everything from tho right in ipset-all
Second, just go in Service.Bat, write 1 and add an service(if not work, try another one.)
That's all!

I'm old!
